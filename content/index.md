CSE 291 is a graduate course on language-based systems security.  Most software
we rely upon is plagued by security vulnerabilities---the common occurrence of
large-scale private data theft alone serves to highlight the magnitude of the
problem. Yet the rise of new application domains and platforms (e.g., crypto
currencies and IoT) is making software ever more integral to daily life.  It
is prudent for us to build more secure software systems.

One promising approach to building secure systems is to leverage ideas from
programming languages and program analysis. The recent industry trend of
adopting new languages, type systems, and tools---as exemplified by Mozilla's
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and Facebook's
[Flow](https://flowtype.org/)---also makes this approach very timely.

This course explores the use of various programming languages and program
analysis methods to **(1)** enforce security, and **(2)** to rigorously specify
and reason about security.  We will study recent systems (e.g., operating
systems, web servers, hardware architectures) and the underlying techniques
used to make them secure (e.g., language-level information flow control,
capabilities, symbolic execution, linear type systems).

#### Lecture

* **Time:** Tuesdays and Thursdays 5:00-6:20PM

#### Instructor

- **Name:** [Deian Stefan](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/)

- **Address:** CSE 3126

#### Prerequisites

While this course is mostly self contained, students should have knowledge of
programming languages (e.g., [CSE 130](http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/cse130)),
operating systems (e.g., [CSE 120](http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/cse120)), and
security (e.g., [CSE 127](http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/cse130)).  We will be reading
research papers on advanced topics with very brief introductions, so students
should be familiar with topics in these areas (e.g., language semantics,
virtual memory management, basic web security).
