In addition to the paper summary, please answer these two questions:

1. Why does Shill rely on contracts? Are capabilities not enough?

2. Why are capability-sandboxed processes (not Shill scripts) vulnerable to the
   confused deputy problem?

  You may find the [notes from last week's class](/notes/confused-deputy/)
  useful if you missed the first class.
