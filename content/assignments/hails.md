1. Does Hails suffer from the external timing channel? If so, explain the
   attack. If not, explain why this is not a concern. Consider the scenario
   where an attacker is able to execute code server-side (e.g., as part of a
   VC).

2. Hails relies on COWL to enforce IFC in the browser. Suppose that was not the
   case. Can you think of a way of addressing leaks due to untrusted HTML using
   a server-side only solution? (_Hint:_ you may want to look at the resin
   assignment for inspiration.) Bonus: What about untrusted JavaScript?
