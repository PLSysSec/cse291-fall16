Please answer any 2 from the following list. We will discuss all of them in class.

1. LIO has a notion of clearance. Why? What is the purpose of clearance at a
   high level?

2. How does LIO side-step the _implicit flows problem_? What's the downside to
   the approach?

3. What is the difference between the termination channel, the internal timing
   channel, and the external timing channel?

4. How can hardware features such as the cache be used to re-introduce the
   internal timing channel?

5. LIO only mitigates the external timing channel. Can you think of a way to
   eliminate the channel? And what is the tradeoff to your approach?
