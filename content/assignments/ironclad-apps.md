1. Describe how declassification works in Ironclad.

2. Why do you think they used UDP and not TCP in their apps?

3. The authors state that extending their verification to reason about
   non-termianting programs is possible, with some work. (Currently you can
   leak data via the termination channel, as we discussed in the LIO lecture.)
   Do you agree? If so, describe what this extension might look like. If not,
   explain why not.
