1. We discussed an alternative approach to the Resin implementation via code
   rewriting. What are 2-3 challenges with this approach? (Hint: some language
   features may make this more difficult than others.)

2. What are some advantages and disadvantages to Resin's policy specification
   approach when compared to label based approaches like LIO?
